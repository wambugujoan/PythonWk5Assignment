🐕🐦🐟📱 OOP in Python – Polymorphism, Inheritance & Encapsulation
📌 Description

This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python:

Polymorphism → different animals (Dog, Bird, Fish) implement move() differently.

Inheritance → Smartphone inherits from the base class Device.

Encapsulation → private attribute (__camera_megapixels) with controlled access.

🎯 Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated

Inheritance → Smartphone inherits from Device.

Encapsulation → private attribute __camera_megapixels.

Polymorphism → Dog, Bird, Fish override move().

Constructors (__init__) → initialize attributes of each object.

Methods → bring the objects to life (take_photo, install_app, power_on, etc.).
